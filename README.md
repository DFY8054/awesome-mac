This application gives me a fantastic experience. For example, when I apply for graduate school, I need to fill out same information on different school. I use <font color=#5898CD>DP</font> to represent <font color=#5898CD>Distinguished Professor, Assistant Dean</font>, I use <font color=#5898CD>ETST</font> to represent my ToEFL Register Number <font color=#5898CD>0000000031323165</font>. This app not only helps me type these information more quickly, but more important, helps me guarantee what I fill out are absolutely right.

#### 14 [KeepingYouAwake](https://github.com/newmarcel/KeepingYouAwake)
_KeepingYouAwake is a small menu bar utility for macOS that can prevent your Mac from entering sleep mode for a predefined duration or as long as it is activated._

![awake](./pictures/awake.png)

It's not rare you are downloading something and leave for a while, when you came back, you Mac got to sleep and the download process stopped. However, with KeepingYouAwake, you Mac can keep awake. For example, when I want to watch a movie, I start a download process and turn on this app, then take a shower. After I come back, the download task is finished and I can watch the movie directly.

I have been finding this kind of applications for so long. For diagrammers, I have Omnigrafe, but for statistical graph, I have no choice but Matlab, which take 11.5G of my 128G Mac. More importantly, Matlab is hard to use. I finally meet Prism. It's size is only about 500M, and it's ability to draw statistical graphs is more powerful.

![Quiver](./pictures/Quiver.png)

Although many similar notebook applications such as Evernote, OneNote, DayOne are very good, I turn to Quiver. The reason is that it combines Latex cells, which means that I can even write down critical mathematic formulations conveniently when I take part in a research meeting.

#### 21 [PDF Expert](https://pdfexpert.com/)
