Recently, several friends asked me to recommend awesome applications for their Macs, so I decided to create this repo to share some useful applications. Feel free to PR if you also want to share with us your fantastic world of Mac.

Let's start from a world "Replacement". Some basic applications created by Apple such as Finder, Mail, Terminal，Spotlight, Stickies, Reminders, are good but not best. They can be replaced by other excellent apps.
